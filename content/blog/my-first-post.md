For years I have been thinking about creating a spot where I can post articles about programming and technology in general. But every attempt to do so have result in complete failure, mostly due to the hassle of setting up maintaining a blog that can be easily updated. I've never been a fan of Wordpress and have experimented with other solutions like Octopress and Jekyll, but none of them felt right to me.

Until I have recently discovered Hugo. It's really awesome and easiy to setup, I can use Markdown to simply create new posts and share my world.

Check it out at:

Let's see if I can keep up with this from now on. Definitely the barrier that was holding me back is gone.

Cheers,
